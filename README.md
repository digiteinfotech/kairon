# Chiron

Chiron is envisioned as a web based microservices driven suite that helps train Rasa contextual AI assistants at scale. It is designed to make the lives of those who work with ai-assistants easy, by giving them a no-coding web interface to adapt , train , test and maintain such assistants .

Adapting contextual AI assistants to specific domain is one of the bigger problems adopting chatbots within organizations. We aim to productionize cutting edge NLP solutions to help users complete the process of conveying domain knowledge to contextual assistants

At this juncture it layers on top of [Rasa Open Source] (https://rasa.com/)

# Deployment
Chiron only requires a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Please do the below changes in **docker/docker-compose.yml**

1. set env variable **server** to public IP of the machine where trainer api docker container is running for example: http://localhost:8001/
    
2. set env variable **SECRET_KEY** to some random key.
    
3. use command **openssl rand -hex 32** for generating random secret key

4. run the command.
 
```shell
cd docker/
docker-compose up -d
```

5. use username: **test@demo.in** and password: **welcome@1** to try with demo user
