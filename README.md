![qrcode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7289292/233619670-4b9adad4-b736-4a18-ad38-0b9e58d506ea.jpeg)

Kairon is now envisioned as a conversational digital transformation platform that helps build LLM based digital assistants at scale. It is designed to make the lives of those who work with ai-assistants easy, by giving them a no-coding web interface to adapt , train , test and maintain such assistants . We are now enhancing the backbone of Kairon with a full fledged context management system to build proactive digital assistants . 

**What is Kairon?**

Kairon is currently a set of tools  built on the RASA framework with a helpful UI interface .
While RASA focuses on technology of chatbots itself. Kairon on the other hand focuses on technology that deal with pre-processing of data that are needed by this framework. These include question augmentation and generation of knowledge graphs that can be used to automatically generate intents, questions and responses.
It also deals with the post processing and maintenance of these bots such metrics / follow-up messages etc. 

**What can it do?**

Kairon is open-source. It is a Conversational digital transformation platform: Kairon is a platform that allows companies to create and deploy digital assistants to interact with customers in a conversational manner.

**End-to-end lifecycle management**: Kairon takes care of the entire digital assistant lifecycle, from creation to deployment and monitoring, freeing up company resources to focus on other tasks.
Tethered digital assistants: Kairon’s digital assistants are tethered to the platform, which allows for real-time monitoring of their performance and easy maintenance and updates as needed.

**Low-code/no-code interface:** Kairon’s interface is designed to be easy for functional users, such as marketing teams or product management, to define how the digital assistant responds to user queries without needing extensive coding skills.
Secure script injection: Kairon’s digital assistants can be easily deployed on websites and SAAS products through secure script injection, enabling organizations to offer better customer service and support.

**Kairon Telemetry:** Kairon’s telemetry feature monitors how users are interacting with the website/product where Kairon was injected and proactively intervenes if they are facing problems, improving the overall user experience.
Chat client designer: Kairon’s chat client designer feature allows organizations to create customized chat clients for their digital assistants, which can enhance the user experience and help build brand loyalty.

**Analytics module:** Kairon’s analytics module provides insights into how users are interacting with the digital assistant, enabling organizations to optimize their performance and provide better service to customers.
Robust integration suite: Kairon’s integration suite allows digital assistants to be served in an omni-channel, multi-lingual manner, improving accessibility and expanding the reach of the digital assistant.

**Realtime struggle analytics:** Kairon’s digital assistants use real-time struggle analytics to proactively intervene when users are facing friction on the product/website where Kairon has been injected, improving user satisfaction and reducing churn.
This website can be found at [Kairon](https://kairon.nimblework.com/) and is hosted by NimbleWork Inc. 

**Who uses it ?**

Kairon is built for two personas 
Teams and Individuals who want an easy no-coding interface to create, train, test and deploy digital assistants . One can directly access these features from our hosted website. Teams who want to host the chatbot trainer in-house. They can build it using docker compose. 
Our teams current focus within NLP is Knowledge Graphs – Do let us know if you are interested. 


At this juncture it layers on top of [Rasa Open Source](https://rasa.com/)

# Deployment
Kairon only requires a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Please do the below changes in **docker/docker-compose.yml**

1. set env variable **server** to public IP of the machine where trainer api docker container is running for example: http://localhost:81

2. **Optional**, if you want to have google analytics enabled then uncomment **trackingid**
and set google analytics tracking id
    
3. set env variable **SECRET_KEY** to some random key.

   use below command for generating random secret key 
   ```shell
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
4. run the command.
 
   ```shell
   cd kairon/docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Open http://localhost/ in browser.

6. To Test use username: **test@demo.in** and password: **Changeit@123** to try with demo user
